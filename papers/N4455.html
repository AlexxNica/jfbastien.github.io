<h2>Abstract<a class="headerlink" href="#abstract" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>False.</p>
<p>Compilers do optimize atomics, memory accesses around atomics, and utilize
architecture-specific knowledge. This paper illustrates a few such
optimizations, and discusses their implications.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="sample-optimizations">
<h2>Sample Optimizations<a class="headerlink" href="#sample-optimizations" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>We list optimizations that are either implemented in LLVM, or will be readily
implemented. A general rule to keep in mind is that the compiler performs many
of its optimizations on and around atomics based on the <em>as-if</em> rule. This
implies that the compiler can make operations <strong>more</strong> atomic as long as it
doesn&#8217;t violate forward progress requirements, and can make them <strong>less</strong> atomic
as long as it doesn&#8217;t add non-benign race which weren&#8217;t already present in the
original program. Put another way, correct programs must work under all
executions an implementation is allowed to create.</p>
<div class="section" id="optimizations-on-atomics">
<h3>Optimizations on Atomics<a class="headerlink" href="#optimizations-on-atomics" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Atomics themselves can be optimized. A non-contentious example is constant
propagation into atomics without other intervening atomics:</p>
<div class="code highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>void inc(std::atomic&lt;int&gt; *y) {
  *y += 1;
}

std::atomic&lt;int&gt; x;
void two() {
  inc(&amp;x);
  inc(&amp;x);
}
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Becomes:</p>
<div class="code highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>std::atomic&lt;int&gt; x;
void two() {
  x += 2;
}
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The above optimization adds atomicity but cannot hinder forward progress, and is
therefore correct. This leads to further optimizations such as using the locked
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">inc</span></tt>/<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">dec</span></tt> instructions instead of locked <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">add</span></tt>/<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">sub</span></tt> when
adding/subtracting <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">1</span></tt> to an atomic on x86:</p>
<div class="code highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>std::atomic&lt;int&gt; x;
void inc(int val) {
  x += 1;
  x += val;
}
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Becomes:</p>
<div class="code highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>_Z3inci:
  lock incl x(%rip)
  lock addl %edi, x(%rip)
  retq
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>In a similar vein, some opportunities for strength reduction will show up
because non-trivial code gets inlined which then exposes fairly silly code, such
as in the following trivial example:</p>
<div class="code highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>template&lt;typename T&gt;
bool silly(std::atomic&lt;T&gt; *x, T expected, T desired) {
  x-&gt;compare_exchange_strong(expected, desired); // Inlined.
  return expected == desired;
}
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Becomes:</p>
<div class="code highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>template&lt;typename T&gt;
bool silly(std::atomic&lt;T&gt; *x, T expected, T desired) {
  return x-&gt;compare_exchange_strong(expected, desired);
}
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The following works for any memory order but <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">release</span></tt> and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">acq_rel</span></tt>:</p>
<div class="code highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>template&lt;typename T&gt;
bool optme(std::atomic&lt;T&gt; *x, T desired) {
  T expected = desired;
  return x-&gt;compare_exchange_strong(expected, desired
    std::memory_order_seq_cst, std::memory_order_relaxed);
}
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Becomes:</p>
<div class="code highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>template&lt;typename T&gt;
bool optme(std::atomic&lt;T&gt; *x, T desired) {
  return x-&gt;load(std::memory_order_seq_cst) == desired;
}
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The above optimization may require that the compiler mark the transformed load
as a <em>release sequence</em> as defined in section 1.10 of the C++ standard.</p>
<p>Similarly, while keeping the resulting memory order stronger or equal to the
individual ones, the following can occur:</p>
<div class="code highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>template&lt;typename T&gt;
T optmetoo(std::atomic&lt;T&gt; *x, T y) {
  T z = x-&gt;load();
  x-&gt;store(y);
  return z;
}
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Becomes:</p>
<div class="code highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>template&lt;typename T&gt;
T optmetoo(std::atomic&lt;T&gt; *x, T y) {
  return x-&gt;exchange(y);
}
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This may not always pay off! In particular, architectures with weaker memory
models may benefit from having write-after-read operations to the same location
instead of having an atomic exchange.</p>
<p>Other simple optimizations can also occur because of inlining and constant
propagation such as turning <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">atomic&lt;T&gt;::fetch_and(~(T)0)</span></tt> into
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">atomic&lt;T&gt;::load()</span></tt>. The same applies for <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">fetch_or(0)</span></tt> and
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">fetch_xor(0)</span></tt>, as well as <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">fetch_and(0)</span></tt> becoming <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">store(0)</span></tt>.</p>
<p>As a slightly different example, the value for <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">std::is_lock_free</span></tt> can be
determined at compile time for some architectures, but for others the compiler
can&#8217;t know the value for all sub-architectures and cannot return a compile-time
constant. The compiler may be given a specific sub-architecture flag to work
around this (restricting which machines the code will execute correctly on) or
must defer to feature detection followed by patching when the program is
loaded. This is the case, for example, for x86&#8217;s <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">LOCK</span> <span class="pre">CMPXCHG16B</span></tt> instruction
which is used to implement lock-free 16-byte operations.</p>
<p>These optimizations aren&#8217;t traditionally performed when using inline assembly
and showcases the strengths of hoisting abstractions to the language level.</p>
<p>The reader for <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seqlock">seqlock</a> bounds ticket acquisition and release with a load and a
fence. This lets the data reads get reordered in-between ticket acquire/release
by using <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">relaxed</span></tt> memory ordering for data. The algorithm retries if the
ticket changed or data was being modified by the writer:</p>
<div class="code highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>std::tuple&lt;T, T&gt; reader() {
  T d1, d2;
  unsigned seq0, seq1;
  do {
    seq0 = seq.load(std::memory_order_acquire);
    d1 = data1.load(std::memory_order_relaxed);
    d2 = data2.load(std::memory_order_relaxed);
    std::atomic_thread_fence(std::memory_order_acquire);
    seq1 = seq.load(std::memory_order_relaxed);
  } while (seq0 != seq1 || seq0 &amp; 1);
  return {d1, d2};
}

void writer(T d1, T d2) {
  unsigned seq0 = seq.load(std::memory_order_relaxed);
  seq.store(seq0 + 1, std::memory_order_relaxed);
  data1.store(d1, std::memory_order_release);
  data2.store(d2, std::memory_order_release);
  seq.store(seq0 + 2, std::memory_order_release);
}
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The reader&#8217;s last ticket load effectively act as a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">release</span></tt> load, which
doesn&#8217;t exist in the current memory model but would better express the intent of
the code while allowing subsequent operations to be moved into the critical
section if profitable. Hans Boehm <a class="reference external" href="http://www.hpl.hp.com/techreports/2012/HPL-2012-68.pdf">suggests</a> using a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">release</span></tt> fetch-add of
zero, and shows that on x86 the code can be written as follows:</p>
<div class="code highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>T d1, d2;
unsigned seq0, seq1;
do {
  seq0 = seq.load(std::memory_order_acquire);
  d1 = data1.load(std::memory_order_relaxed);
  d2 = data2.load(std::memory_order_relaxed);
  seq1 = seq.fetch_add(0, std::memory_order_release);
} while (seq0 != seq1 || seq0 &amp; 1);
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This rewritten code then generates the following x86 assembly:</p>
<div class="code highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>.LBB0_1:
      movl    seq(%rip), %esi
      movl    data1(%rip), %ecx
      movl    data2(%rip), %eax
      mfence
      movl    seq(%rip), %edi
      movl    %esi, %edx
      andl    $1, %edx
      cmpl    %edi, %esi
      jne     .LBB0_1
      testl   %edx, %edx
      jne     .LBB0_1
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This x86 assembly reduces contention by replacing <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">fetch_add</span></tt>—an instruction
requiring exclusive cache line access—to a simple <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">movl</span></tt>. This optimization is
currently only known to be correct on x86, is probably correct for other
architectures, and is <a class="reference external" href="http://reviews.llvm.org/D5091">currently implemented in LLVM</a>.</p>
<p>Similar to the above <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">release</span></tt> fetch-add of zero serving as a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">release</span></tt>
load, one could also use an <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">acquire</span></tt> exchange when an <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">acquire</span></tt> store is
desired.</p>
<p>Traditional compiler optimizations, such as dead store elimination, can be
performed on atomic operations, even sequentially consistent ones. Optimizers
have to be careful to avoid doing so across synchronization points because
another thread of execution can observe or modify memory, which means that the
traditional optimizations have to consider more intervening instructions than
they usually would when considering optimizations to atomic operations. In the
case of dead store elimination it isn&#8217;t sufficient to prove that an atomic store
post-dominates and aliases another to eliminate the other store.</p>
<p>A trickier example is fusion of <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">relaxed</span></tt> atomic operations, even when
interleaved:</p>
<div class="code highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>std::atomic&lt;int&gt; x, y;
void relaxed() {
  x.fetch_add(1, std::memory_order_relaxed);
  y.fetch_add(1, std::memory_order_relaxed);
  x.fetch_add(1, std::memory_order_relaxed);
  y.fetch_add(1, std::memory_order_relaxed);
}
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Becomes:</p>
<div class="code highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>std::atomic&lt;int&gt; x, y;
void relaxed() {
  x.fetch_add(2, std::memory_order_relaxed);
  y.fetch_add(2, std::memory_order_relaxed);
}
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>We aren&#8217;t aware of compilers performing this optimization yet, but <a class="reference external" href="https://llvm.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=16477">it is being
discussed</a>. <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">std::atomic_signal_fence</span></tt> could be used to prevent this
reordering and fusion, or one could use a stronger memory ordering for the
operations: this optimization is only valid on relaxed operations which aren&#8217;t
ordered with respect to each other.</p>
<p>A compiler can tag all functions on whether they have atomic instructions or
not, and optimize around call sites accordingly. This could even be done for all
virtual overrides when we can enumerate them, and can be used to carve out
different <a class="reference external" href="http://www.hpl.hp.com/techreports/2011/HPL-2011-57.pdf">inteference-free regions</a>.</p>
<p>Fence instructions are generated as a consequence of C++&#8217;s
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">std::atomic_thread_fence</span></tt> as well as, on some architectures, atomic
operations. Fence instructions tend to be expensive, and removing redundant ones
as well as positioning them optimally leads to great performance gains, while
keeping the code correct and simple. This is <a class="reference external" href="http://reviews.llvm.org/D5758">currently under review in LLVM</a>.</p>
<p>Not all compiler optimizations are valid on atomics, this topic is still under
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.di.ens.fr/~zappa/readings/c11comp.pdf">active research</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="optimizations-around-atomics">
<h3>Optimizations Around Atomics<a class="headerlink" href="#optimizations-around-atomics" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Compilers can optimize non-atomic memory accesses before and after atomic
accesses. A somewhat surprising example is that the following code can be (<a class="reference external" href="http://reviews.llvm.org/D4845">and
is</a>!) transformed as shown, where <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">x</span></tt> is a non-atomic global.</p>
<div class="code highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>int x = 0;
std::atomic&lt;int&gt; y;
int dso() {
  x = 0;
  int z = y.load(std::memory_order_seq_cst);
  y.store(0, std::memory_order_seq_cst);
  x = 1;
  return z;
}
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Becomes:</p>
<div class="code highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>int x = 0;
std::atomic&lt;int&gt; y;
int dso() {
  // Dead store eliminated.
  int z = y.load(std::memory_order_seq_cst);
  y.store(0, std::memory_order_seq_cst);
  x = 1;
  return z;
}
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The intuition behind the dead store elimination optimization is that the only
way another thread could have observed the dead store elimination is if their
code had been racy in the first place: only a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">release</span></tt>/<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">acquire</span></tt> pair could
have been synchronized with another thread that observed the store (see <a class="reference external" href="http://www.di.ens.fr/~zappa/readings/pldi13.pdf">this
paper</a> for details). Sequentially consistent accesses are
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">acquire</span></tt>/<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">release</span></tt>, the key in this example is having the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">release</span></tt> store
come before the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">acquire</span></tt> load and synchronize with another thread (which the
loop does by observing changes in <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">y</span></tt>).</p>
<p>The following code, with a different store/load ordering and using
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">release</span></tt>/<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">acquire</span></tt> memory ordering, can also be transformed as shown (but
currently isn&#8217;t, at least in LLVM).</p>
<div class="code highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>int x = 0;
std::atomic&lt;int&gt; y;
int rlo() {
  x = 0;
  y.store(0, std::memory_order_release);
  int z = y.load(std::memory_order_acquire);
  x = 1;
  return z;
}
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Becomes:</p>
<div class="code highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>int x = 0;
std::atomic&lt;int&gt; y;
int rlo() {
  // Dead store eliminated.
  y.store(0, std::memory_order_release);
  // Redundant load eliminated.
  x = 1;
  return 0; // Stored value propagated here.
}
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The above example&#8217;s load can be eliminated because there was no synchronization
with another thread: even if the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">release</span></tt> is followed by an <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">acquire</span></tt> the
compiler is allowed to assume that the stored value wasn&#8217;t modified before the
subsequent load, and that the load is therefore redundant.</p>
<p>Whereas the following code must (and does!) remain the same:</p>
<div class="code highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>int x = 0;
std::atomic&lt;int&gt; y;
int no() {
  x = 0;
  y.store(0, std::memory_order_release);
  while (!y.load(std::memory_order_acquire));
  x = 1;
  return z;
}
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Other optimizations such as global value ordering across atomics can be applied.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="mutex-safer-than-atomics">
<h3>Mutex: Safer than Atomics?<a class="headerlink" href="#mutex-safer-than-atomics" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The same optimization potential applies to C++&#8217;s <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">std::mutex</span></tt>: locking a mutex
is equivalent to <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">acquire</span></tt> memory ordering, and unlocking a mutex is
equivalent to <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">release</span></tt> memory ordering. Using a mutex correctly is slightly
easier because the API is simpler than atomic&#8217;s API.</p>
<p>Some current implementations rely on pthread&#8217;s mutex, which may not expose all
optimization opportunities because the compiler may not know how to handle the
slow-path futex (usually a syscall), or because the implementation is in a
different translation unit. The optimization difficulties can be overcome by
teaching the compiler to treat <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">std::mutex</span></tt> or pthread specially, or by
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2014/n4195.pdf">making it practical to implement mutexes in pure C++</a>. Optimization across
translation units, such as through link-time optimizations, or optimizations
relying on escape analysis, can also help expose more opportunities.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="optimizations-without-atomics">
<h3>Optimizations without Atomics<a class="headerlink" href="#optimizations-without-atomics" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Another interesting optimization is to use potentially shared memory locations
(on the stack, heap and globals) as scratch storage, if the compiler can prove
that they are not accessed in other threads concurrently. This is spelled out in
the C++11 standard in section 1.10 ¶22. For example the following transformation
could occur:</p>
<div class="code highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>// Some code, but no synchronization.
*p = 1; // Can be on stack, heap or global.
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Becomes:</p>
<div class="code highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>// ...
*p = RAX; // Spill temporary value.
// ...
RAX = *p; // Restore temporary value.
// ...
*p = 1;
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Since we write to <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">*p</span></tt> and there is no synchronization operations, other
threads do not read/write <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">*p</span></tt> without exercising undefined behavior. We can
therefore use it as scratch storage—and thus reduce stack frame size—without
changing the observable behavior of the program. This requires escape analysis:
the compiler must see the full scope of memory location <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">p</span></tt>, or must know that
leaf functions don&#8217;t capture <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">p</span></tt> and aren&#8217;t used concurrently, for this
optimization to be valid.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="architecture-and-implementation-specific-optimizations">
<h3>Architecture and Implementation Specific Optimizations<a class="headerlink" href="#architecture-and-implementation-specific-optimizations" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Optimizations can sometimes be made per-architecture, or even per specific
implementation of an architecture. Compilers can usually be told to target
specific architectures, CPUs or attributes using flags such as <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-march</span></tt>,
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-mcpu</span></tt>, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-mattr</span></tt>.</p>
<p>Spinloops are usually implemented with an <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">acquire</span></tt> load, which are equivalent
to a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">relaxed</span></tt> load followed by an <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">acquire</span></tt> fence in the loop. On some
architecture implementations it may make sense to hoist the fence outside the
loop, but how and when to do this is architecture specific. In a similar way,
mutexes usually want to be implemented as a spinloop with exponential randomized
backoff followed by a futex. The right implementation of mutexes is highly
platform-dependent.</p>
<p>Instructions can also be implemented in manners that are nominally incorrect for
the architecture in general, but happen to be correct for specific
implementations of the architecture. For example, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">release</span></tt> fences should lower to
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">dmb</span> <span class="pre">ish</span></tt> on ARM, but <a class="reference external" href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-commits/Week-of-Mon-20130701/thread.html#179911">on Apple&#8217;s Swift processor</a> they lower to <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">dmb</span>
<span class="pre">ishst</span></tt> instead, which would be incorrect on other ARM processors. Some ARM
processors can go even further and remove all <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">dmb</span></tt> which aren&#8217;t system-wide
because their memory model is much stronger than ARM&#8217;s prescribed model.</p>
<p>Some architectures support transactional memory. A compiler can use this
knowledge to make many consecutive atomic writes into a single atomic
transaction, and retry on commit failure. It can also speculate that many reads
and writes aren&#8217;t accessed concurrently, or that certain locks aren&#8217;t contended,
and fall back to a slow path, or to smaller transactions, if a commit failure
limit is reached. Such approaches have been implemented using Intel&#8217;s <a class="reference external" href="https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=2579227">RTM and
HLE</a> extensions.</p>
<p>Other architectures do dynamic binary translation behind the scenes, and also
use transactional memory. This can lead to further in-hardware optimizations as
well as fairly hard to predict behavior: sometimes races aren&#8217;t observed because
big transactions commit, and other times they do occur because transactions are
smaller. This certainly makes micro-benchmarking hard, if not impossible.</p>
<p>The same applies for simulators and emulators which often just-in-time translate
the code they&#8217;re executing—leading to hard-to-predict behavior—and which also
often emulate multi-core systems using cooperative thread switching—leading to
predictable interleaving which is easier to optimize for the simulator.</p>

<h3>Volatility<a class="headerlink" href="#volatility" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Atomic operations are unsuitable to express that memory locations can be
externally modified. Indeed, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">volatile</span></tt> (or <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">volatile</span> <span class="pre">atomic</span></tt>) should be
used in these circumstances.</p>
<p>Shared memory isn&#8217;t explicitly defined by the C++ standard, yet programmers
often use operating system APIs to map the same physical memory location onto
multiple virtual addresses in the same process, or across processes. A
sufficiently advanced compiler, performing some of the optimizations described
above, can seriously harm code which uses shared memory naïvely.</p>
<p>The C++ standard says that lock-free atomic operations must be <em>address free</em> to
address such issues, but this mandate isn&#8217;t normative.</p>

<h3>For the Standards Committee<a class="headerlink" href="#for-the-standards-committee" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Don&#8217;t assume that these optimizations don&#8217;t occur, but rather encourage
them. Standardize more common practice that enable to-the-metal
optimizations. Provide more libraries that make it easy to use concurrency and
parallelism and hard to get it wrong.</p>

<h3>For Developers<a class="headerlink" href="#for-developers" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Drop assembly: it can&#8217;t be optimized as well and is only tuned to the
architectures that existed when you originally wrote the code. File bugs when
performance expectations aren&#8217;t met by the compiler. Suggest to the standard
committee new idiomatic patterns which enable concurrency and parallelism. Use
the tooling available to you, such as ThreadSanitizer, to find races in your
code.</p>

<p>Get back to work, there&#8217;s so much more to optimize… and so much code to break!
Help users write good code: the compiler should provide diagnostics when it
detects anti-patterns or misuses of atomics.</p>
